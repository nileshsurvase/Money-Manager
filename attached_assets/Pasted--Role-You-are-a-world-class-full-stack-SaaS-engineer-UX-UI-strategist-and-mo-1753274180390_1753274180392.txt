### ✅ \[Role]:

You are a **world-class full-stack SaaS engineer**, **UX/UI strategist**, and **mobile-first optimization specialist** building production-grade apps with Google OAuth, and AI-enhanced dashboards.

---

### 📌 \[Context]:

We are building "**Money Manager**" – the fastest, cleanest, most intuitive Indian expense tracker for web + mobile. It runs on Replit, supports Google Login to manage access.

The current desktop version UI is clean, but the mobile UX needs heavy refinement. The backend must support secure, token-based login, real-time updates, and dynamic data display. Data will be backed up to Google Drive, automatically and securely.

---

### 🎯 \[Task]:

Design and build the **full stack** for Money Manager with:

#### 🔐 Login & Auth

* ✅ Google OAuth 2.0 login (no anonymous access)
* ✅ Session/token-based auth for protected backend routes
* ✅ Only logged-in users access the dashboard
* ✅ Auto-create secure Google Drive file (if not exists)


#### 📱 UI/UX Requirements

* ✅ Match exact design of \[Login UI in Screenshot]
* ✅ Creamy white layout with soft orange gradients
* ✅ All menus and headers in **faded orange** palette
* ✅ Orange theme across dashboard – shades must match and be elegant, not harsh
* ✅ Mobile-first layout (100% responsive)

##### 🔄 Month Navigation

* ❌ Currently: left/right arrows misaligned
* ✅ Fix: make arrows in one row → `← Month Name →`
* ✅ Change: "This Month" + "Last Month" boxes from column → row layout

##### ➕ Add Expense Modal

* ✅ Add a category: **AYS**
* ✅ In AYS: allow creating **custom categories** on the fly
* ✅ UX should instantly add new category and auto-select it

##### 📊 Dashboard Panels

* ✅ Use visually appealing orange theme for all panels
* ✅ Remove unnecessary white/empty spaces in uncollapsed category view
* ✅ For each expense:

  * Top Left: Note/Title
  * Top Right: ₹Amount
  * Bottom Left: Date
  * Bottom Right: 🗑️ delete button

##### 📈 Expense by Category Chart

* ✅ Use smart contrasting colors that look elegant on orange theme
* ✅ Improve color palette for readability and clarity

### 🔍 AI-Powered Features

* ✅ "Smart Spending Insight" card

  * E.g. *"Food spend increased by 37% this month"*
* ✅ AI-based auto-categorization of common expenses (optional future)

---

### 📅 Filters & Budgeting

* ✅ Custom date range filtering
* ✅ Monthly budget per category (with 80%+ usage alert)
* ✅ Preload previous/next month data (no delay on switch)
* ❌ Remove month picker – only allow: `This Month` and `Last Month` (automatic)

---

### ⚙️ Deployment Goals

prepare as easily deployble on the custom hosting 


### ⚡ Performance

* ✅ Instant load for each month’s data
* ✅ Lazy-load or prefetch charts
* ✅ Optimize assets and eliminate all layout shifts on mobile

---

### 🧠 \[Output Format]:

Code, UI mockups, and file structure must follow:

* 🗂 Clean modular structure
* 📄 One `README.md` with deployment guide
* ⚙️ Config-ready `.env.example` with variable names
* 🎨 Consistent theme using TailwindCSS or CSS Variables
